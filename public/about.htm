			<p>I developed Essentials because I wanted to create a better way for me to manage my household expendables and organize my shopping list via computer or mobile device. Not wanting to keep the application to myself, I decided to make Essentials a web application accessible to anyone.</p> 
			<p>If you had questions about Essentials or had issues with your Essentials account, please feel free to <a href="mailto:rso136@gmail.com" target="_blank">contact me.</a> I am always open to feedback or suggestions.</p>

		 	<h2><b>How Essentials Works</b></h2>
		 	<br>
		 	<h3>1. Track your home products which need to be replenished regularly by entering them into your personalized inventory.</h3>
		 	<br>

		 	<br>
		 	<h3>2. Whenever you expend an item, easily subtract it from your inventory through either your mobile device or computer.</h3>

		 	<br>
		 	<h3>3. The Essentials app will automatically add fully expended items to your own shopping list so you don't have to worry about recalling what you need next time you go shopping.</h3>

		 	<h3>4. Knock items off your automated shopping list as you add them to your cart or once you're back home. Items crossed off your list will instantaneously return to your inventory for continued management.</h3>
